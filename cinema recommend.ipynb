    "- **Email Prompt**: Streamlit asked for your email to send helpful onboarding information and promotional offers. Since you provided your email (`sommohini342000@gmail.com`), it will send you updates and other information, but this is **not required** to run the app locally.\n",
    "- **App is Running**: Your Streamlit app is now running, and the URLs below are where you can view it:\n",
    "  - **Local URL**: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)\n",
    "  - **Network URL**: [http://192.168.43.156:8501](http://192.168.43.156:8501)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to View the App:\n",
    "1. **Open Your Browser**: Open a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).\n",
    "2. **Go to Local URL**: Type or paste the **Local URL**: `http://localhost:8501` into the address bar.\n",
    "   - This will show you the app running locally on your machine.\n",
